##1.  Description

dBargainz is a web application by which registered users can post and share "bargains" to save a buck or two.  dBargainz typically contain  bargains and special deals posted by other users, followed by a description and a link to the website or deal.  The user will also have the ability to upvote or downvote a deal/bargain to show other users how good the deal is. A registered user will also have the ability to comment on posts/deals for other users to read.

##4.  Technologies

Technologies used to build this app include:  Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS.  In addition, PostgreSQL was used in the formation of the database.  Also, Trello was used for my project management and workflow assistance with Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) and user stages.  Heroku is being used as a cloud platform to host the application.

##6.  Installation/Startup Instructions

Instructions for use are straightforward.  Simply direct your browser to the application URL and load the page.  You will have the option to Sign up, Log In, or just browse deals.  As a registered user you will have the option to create, edit, or delete deals and upload pictures/links. It is similar in style to oZbargains.
